# Welcome to the Electric Tantra

## Quick Start 

If you are booting from the ISO and don't know how to work with this system, have no fear! Press `mod4 + Insert` for a list of key bindings currently configured on the system. 

Then Go Ahead and take the system for a spin. If you hate it, delete it but if you like it, you can install it locally from the ISO booted on bare metal.


## Problems? 
If you have a problem, hit the repo of the project with an issue and I will try to get to to a response promptly and patiently. Remember this is a one dev show and I try very hard to get to everything, but life happens, so errors and delays should be expected.
