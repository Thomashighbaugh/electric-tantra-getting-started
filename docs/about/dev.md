I am a software engineer who works mostly with web technologies forging interactive and beautiful web interfaces with a passion and interest in the Linux OS environment generally and with the customization of its interfaces specifically. 

## What Possessed Me to Take On Making My Own Arch Variant?


My motivation as stated elsewhere was to make it easy for users to try out my highly opinionated Awesome WM configuration, or what I have dubbed locally `Flying Spaghetti Code Monster` because of its size and Lua's tendency to being ugly and hard to read. 

## Credit Where It Is Due
Well some awesome developers forged the way and going over how they had done it, made it possible for me to do and I would not have been able to do this were everyone like me and quietly lurking Reddit and Arch Linux's forums for information. 

The authors of the projects included in `libs/` are all very awesome and I am most thankful for their work I was able to utilize in a mostly unmodified fashion (and submit pull requests to fix errors of course). In particular I found useful the work of:
- [streetturtle](https://github.com/streetturtle) - His widget library is remarkably well documented for anything related to AwesomeWM and I appreciate the star on my repo long before it was released!
- [mut-ex](https://github.com/mut-ex) - His Nice titlebar control library is the best solution to standardizing the titlebar and its buttons smoothly and giving it your own personal touch. Really dig the project. 
-[raksoo](https://github.com/raksooo) - Author of Poppin, the solution that works for my dropdown terminal needs (maybe I will rewrite this myself, I had once before but time is limited) 
#### More coming soon



Additionally, there are several configurations that I found in my exploration of the others who made modular AwesomeWM configurations. In particular I would like to thank:
- [elenapan](https://github.com/elenapan) - her configuration is beautiful. I may have wise cracks to make about directory names but everyone is in debt to her for making it clear what kinds of interfaces can be made with Awesome. 
- [manilarome](https://github.com/manilarome) - probably the most maximum configuration that works out of the box, mostly. He might benefit from copying me and making an ISO for his system, but its got `EVERYTHING` except the kitchen sink (emacs is fine but that is a little much all)
- [willpowers](https://github.com/WillPower3309) - probably the best organized configuration I have happened upon. He has his own taste as far as decals and titlebars, but there is no better repo to structure your own off of than his. 
- [actionless](https://github.com/actionless) - awesome configuration, even if I have a lot of those same bases covered just differently, he's a maintainer of the AwesomeWM project itself which is certainly reflected in the config as he seems capable of magical things

#### More coming soon
