# Art 
All of the artwork that is associated with Electric Tantra Linux is either my own or its something found online in some seemingly free context and then heavily modified. 

It turns out a have a hand in art, considering I have had shakey hands my whole life and can't draw very well, this came as a shock to the people around me and myself. What better way to showcase some of my work then to use it in sites and now a customized Linux variant? I spend enough time hating GIMP that I might as well post the stuff to places other than my instagram

## Imagery & Symbolism
A common motiff used throughout the Awesome configuration and Electric Tantra Linux is the `Kali Yantra` which is a depiction of the Hindu Goddess Kali particularly revered by Tantric practioners and me, as it happens. Having been capitvated with the image since first seeing it while looking up the very `death metal` imagery of Kali in `gross`, or physical, form. The image has become a sort of personal icon and is featured in a lot of my artistic work.

### I Did Not Make Any of the Related Pieces Depicting the Lady Kali or Other Gods
Additionally, you may find other works that are pictures of the Goddess or of other Hindu Gods, I did not make these images and lack artists to credit for them but would love any information about such that anyone has.

### A Means of Praise, or Electric Yoga 
My use of these religious icons in my Linux distro has a cheeky element to it, specifically that nothing has taught me mediative patience like decade old Linux window managers with a tendency to break at the worst times, but this is not intended as a disrespectful act but instead a means of praise through labor to achieve a higher understanding, a sort of electric yoga if you will (hence the name).
