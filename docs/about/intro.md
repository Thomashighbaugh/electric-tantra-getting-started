# About Electric Tantra Linux 
 ## The What
 This project is an Arch Linux variant, (the 'arch btw' meme is getting as old as the people doing it in the first place, please friends spare me) which features my heavily customized AwesomeWM configuration as the default window manager.
 
 ## The Why
 The utility of dealing with this immense Linux frustration has been to create the best way I can imagine to preview my dotfiles, specifically the AwesomeWM config I spent `way too much time on` to others without needing them to resort to the not-fully-functional AWMTT emulation or hassle with backing up their dotfiles first, which can easily lead to disasters.
